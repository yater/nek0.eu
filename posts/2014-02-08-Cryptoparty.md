I am just attending a cryptoparty, where we sign each other's pgp-keys.

It is my first time doing so, but I think it is very important to know your possibilities, especially in the light of recent events and revelations. This is also one of the reasons I run my own mailserver. Other reasons are just to see if I can.

On this occasion I stumbled upon the debian package "signing-party" and the tool in it called `sig2dot`, which creates a nice graph out of your key signatures. Although dot has its flaws, I think this is a wonderful way to visualize your chains of trust.
