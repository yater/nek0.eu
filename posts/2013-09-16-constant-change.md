As promised in the about-page, i have made some improvements to this blog. I am now officially using html5.  
I have introduced <code>nav</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> tags where necessary.  
Additionally, for those with mobile devices, all screens with a width of 600px and lesser get a more declutterized version of the site with no navigation sidebar but as a line above the article.  
I hope you enjoy it.
