First of all I have to apologize for not updating my blog in the past months.
I have been very busy in that time, having my internship and having it converted
to a part-time job, after which I hopefully will be starting my apprenticeship.

In my free time I am still pursuing my projects and starting new ones. For
example: My Game Engine makes progress so far, that I am now implementing
physics. It's still in testing and doesn't work always right, but the tests look
promising.

My book also does some progress. I actually managed to make it some kind of
habit to work on it at least on sundays. I usually meet with my older brother
and we discuss things related to writing, while we both work on our books. It's
cool to exchange Ideas this way and ask for an opinion, when one of us is stuck.

That's about it. see you soon.
