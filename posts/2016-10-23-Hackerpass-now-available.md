Hi folks. This weekend I was able to make a great accomplishment. I released my
version of the hacker passport at the [Datenspuren][ds] event.

The reason why I even started making this passport was, that I haven't found any
source files of existing hacker passports editable with free software. So I
started making my own. I used [Inkscape][is] and [GIMP][] for images and
[Scribus][scr] for layouting the passport. The result can be seen [here][pass]
in my Github account.

The reception of the passport at the event was quite good and I hope to
distribute even more of them on the Chaos Communication Congress in December.
