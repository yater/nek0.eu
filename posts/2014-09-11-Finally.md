description: Commenting System is ready for testing
---

Finally I made it. The commenting system I have been working on for the past few months is deployed for testing.

Also the blog was moved to another server, as I give up my own little sandbox of virtual server, which has become increasingly unreliable. Hence the outage from last month, for which I am very sorry. Soon I will also have set up my domain here.

As you can see, the iframes have come to life with the promised commenting system. feel free to comment anything you want under any blog post. Knock yourselves out. Unfortunately, I can't guarantee, that your comments will stay, as this is just a test deployment and I will still work heavily on the code.

When you encounter any problems, errors, bugs or have feature requests, drop an issue at the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/nek0/yacs).
