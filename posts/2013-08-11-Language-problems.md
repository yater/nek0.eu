description: Problem with language choice in the blog
---

Because I am capable of fluently communicating in three languages, I now have a Problem with the decision, in which one of them i will write this blog. For now I am using english because it's the most widely used language in the world that I can communicate in.

In the future I might write posts that only matter in one country or one city. Maybe i will even comment on the politics in the country i live in, but that's not an english speaking country.

Maybe I will write the posts in any language I see fit at the Moment and tag it with its language. That should do it.
