Today I have a very strange and very rare Moodswing. I'm in a good mood, which is great.

I know I am sick and will be for some time in the future, but today I see a better future. It's not an easy time for me, not knowing exactly, why I am sick or even what exactly it is I suffer from.  
My doctors do their best to treat me and my friends are a great support. I wish to thank them all for keeping up with me.

This moment is very precious to me and I hope that once in a while everybody has a similar feeling.
