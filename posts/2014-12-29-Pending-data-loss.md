description: Due to a software upgrade the commenting system will lose all comments

I have an unfortunate announcement to make. Due to a software upgrade the commenting system will lose all comments. This has to do something with the upgrade of the package dependency on `persistent` to a version greater than 2.0.

I will wait until my issues with other dependencies are closed for pushing some dependency boundaries, so it will  build on the server without dependency hell.

***EDIT from 30.12.2014:***

After looking deeper into that matter, I have fund out, that I will be able to migrate the data. So no dataloss will happen. Sorry for the hassle.
