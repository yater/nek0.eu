Hi guys. I am having a serious problem with my writing for the past few months.

I am not getting anywhere.

I suspect I have a writer's block.

A writer's block is that strange state which I perceive as the inability to come
up with Ideas. I stare at a blank page (more precisely a blank screen in my
case) and my mind is just as blank. I look through my notes, but no new pictures
form in my mind. This is extremely frustrating and the longer it lasts the more
I doubt that my work is good enough to be published one day.

I'm trying not to put myself under too much pressure because of this, but it's
not easy. I always tend to compare myself with times before. When I was at the
beginning, I had tons of ideas around and was barely fast enough to put them all
down. I suspect that I even missed a great portion of them.

To make things worse, I have not yet managed to make my writing a habit, which
might be beneficial to my case. I only wrote occasionally and for about 3 months
I did not write at all.

I don't like the idea of abandoning my project even temporarily. I just like the
world and the people I created too much. It would feel like betraying them.

I don't know what to do.
