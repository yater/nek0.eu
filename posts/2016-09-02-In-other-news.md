description: What went on in my life recently
---

Hi folks. I'm sorry I missed to make a blogpost last month, so this one is
coming early. The reason for this is, that a lot went on in my life recently. I
had to make hard decisions and set a new course.

I will be quitting university at the end of this semester. I'm not glad about it
and it still bugs me and fills me with uncertainty about my future, but
rationally it's the only way. I couldn't continue studying and working at the
same time to pay the bills *and* stay psychologically healthy. It didn't work
out for the last three years and it wouldn't in the foreseeable future.

With the university not being available as a source of qualification, I'm now
trying to get a training as IT specialist. Working on and with computers has
given me a lot of enjoyment in the past years. I learned to code and how to
maintain Linux systems and I loved to do this in my free time. Maybe that's my
vocation.

In parallel to my training, which will not start before next year, and until
then I will need a thorough psychological treatment. I can't bury my past as I
initially wanted to. It still affects me. I need to get rid of certain automated
patterns I still follow. They are not doing me good anymore. I need to work on
my crappy past and what happened to me. Wounds also need to be treated properly,
before you can work again.

In conclusion I would like to thank everyone who has helped me so far. I hope I
can repay you in any way.
