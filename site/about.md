# Hi there!

You found your way to my little spot in the internet and you want to know more.

So be it!

## About me

The name I identify with is nek0. This is of course a nickname. I live in
Central Europe as a random dude. In my free time I like to code, play piano,
sing and read books. I have a very broad taste in music and a great deal
of understanding.

## About this site

<img alt="Haskell logo" src="/images/haskell-logo.png" style="width:auto">
This site came to existence as a byproduct of an experiment. I am trying to
configure and maintain my own server.

This blog is generated with the static site generator [Hakyll][h], which is
written in Haskell, my favourite programming language so far. I myself am not
very skilled in that language yet, but i find it very fascinating.

As you can see I have been successful so far.

Due to this experimental state it is very likely that the appearance of this
site will change over time.
