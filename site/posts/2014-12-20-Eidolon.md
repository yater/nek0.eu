description: introducing my very own gallery service
---

Those who follow my actions on [GitHub](https://github.com/nek0) may know it already, but for those who don't it's new, that I was working on a gallery system called [Eidolon](https://github.com/nek0/eidolon) for some time. It is a project which I started in the late phase of my commentary system [Yacs](https://github.com/nek0/yacs) due to my growing discomfort with [Mediagoblin](http://mediagoblin.org/), which is currently in use at our hackerspace.

The name derives from the same greek word which means something like mirage or illusion. I can't really say, why I named it like that, but I'm quite happy with the name.

The gallery system is almost complete and I will start stress testing it in the next year. The images in the gallery are organized in albums, which themselves belong to certain users. Additional features include at the moment:

* Commenting pictures
* Tagging pictures
* sharing albums with other users
* Atom and RSS feeds of the whole gallery, users, albums and picture comments.
* HMAC-SHA user authentication

The whole system is set up as a [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/) webapp and is written mostly in Haskell.

I have been working with Yesod for quite some time now, mostly for learning Haskell, but I found it also entertaining to make some web-development. I would really recommend using this framework. The static typing of Haskell might be a bit of a pain in the butt at first, but it also grants your applications level of security, which I haven't observed anywhere else.
