description: fixed an error with the RSS- and Atom-Feeds

First I have to apologise, that I haven't found the error earlier, it was literally a single line of code.

For all those relying on my feeds, you may have encountered problems with links going still to the old server. After I moved my server to a new location I forgot to change the feed settings accordingly. Now I fixed it.
