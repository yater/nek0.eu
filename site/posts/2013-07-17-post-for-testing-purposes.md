##Hello World!

This is a post in which I try to use the markdown language for writing my own posts.

Markdown is very useful for this purpose since it does not clutter the sourcefile with tags, which need to be opened and closed and thus making it hard to read. Most of the topology
of the outcoming texts like headlines, paragraphs or even more like links to different sites can be managed in a more easier and convenient way.

If you have become interested in learning how to use markdown you can look at [Wikipedia's page on markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown at Wikipedia").

Have fun!
