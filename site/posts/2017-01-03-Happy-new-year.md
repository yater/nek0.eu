Congress is over, the new year has begun. I hope you all had pleasant holidays
and a good start into the new year. I was able to spend New Years Eve with
good friends and relax from congress.

Congress was a new experience for me and sometimes a difficult one. I still
don't handle large crowds very well. Luckily I had some kind of place of
retreat at the assembly table of our hackerspace.

My problem with large crowds made it hard to visit many talks, but luckily I
will be able to watch them on <http://media.ccc.de> thanks to the great work of
the VOC team. At least I got to socialise a little with people I usually don't
meet due to geographical circumstances.

With me usually spending much time at the assembly table I indulged into
programming Haskell. I wanted to see how much my project of the past few months,
my game engine [Affection][aff], has grown into a usable state. I implemented a
game similar to [Asteroids][ast] called "Haskelloids", whose code base can be
seen [on Github][has]. It is basically playable, but I'm still in the process of
refining it further. Not only the game, but also the engine are still rough at
the edges.

Unfortunately I didn't dare to make many photos at congress, but when I have my
films developed I'll upload what I have.
