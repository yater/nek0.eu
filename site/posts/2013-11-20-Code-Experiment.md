Today I made some effort to learn a bit more in Haskell and finished a working implementation of the unix utility ddate. It is nothing much, but it means a alot to me that I start to understand how to think in the paradigm of the language. If you are curious about my code, have a look at [my github account](https://github.com/nek0/n-ddate).
