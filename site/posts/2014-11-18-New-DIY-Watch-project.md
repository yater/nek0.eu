description: Another crazy project by me
---

After long hours of browsing in the depths of the internet I stumbeled upon the ["Chronode VFD"](http://www.johngineer.com/blog/?p=1595) watch.

The first time I saw it I was completely baffled. I immediately wanted one of my own, but with some alterations. Problem is: I have absolutely no experience in hardware hacking. Luckily as a frequent visitor of my local hackerspace I know some people who have experience.

First I want to build a simplified version without that gorgeous vacuum fluorescence tube using LED-Modules as display and thus give it a longer battery life.

For now I am creating a bill of materials and looking for parts. you can check the progress at the [github project](https://github.com/nek0/pentawatch) I created and occasionally I will post the progress here.
