description: Syntax highlighting in code bubbles is the new feature.

Hey folks!
I have been tinkering again with this site and i found out that my markdown compiler pandoc supports syntax highlighting, so from now on all code bubbles will have proper syntax highlighting. Additionally I played with the navbar and the code bubbles themselves, so they show the proper language.
