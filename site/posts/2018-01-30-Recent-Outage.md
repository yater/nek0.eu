description: Sorry for the recent outage

I'm sorry for the recent outage in my services. I was foolish enough to think,
that I can restart a LXC Container after an update without any hassle.

The whole problem boils down to an incompatibility between unprivileged LXC
Containers and systemd. Thanks a lot for breaking our stuff.

But now everything is fine, my site is runnning again and so is
[eidolon](https://eidolon.nek0.eu).
