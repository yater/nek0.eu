description: I'm getting better, thank you.

Hi folks, long time no see.

Since the middle of June tings gradually change for me. I am in psychiatry
again, but the outlook is pretty good. I'm geting new medication, which replaces
the cocktail I formerly got. This means less side effects and this new meds seem
to be really working. I feel more energetic than I felt for a long time,
probably years.

I am looking forward to leaving the clinic, yet I still feel anxious about how
life will go on. I deeply hope the positive effects prevail and I can continue
my apprenticeship as energetically as I feel at the moment.

Other positive effects of my stay here is, that I finally found the time to
learn to draw with classical media and I stuck with aquarel colors, because they
work well in my mind. But their outcome is sometimes a bit unpreditable,
especially when applying "wet" techniques. I'll probably have some off my
pictures I made in clinic scanned and will post them on my deviantart account.
I should generally post more stuff there. As well as here.

With all that being said, I hope you all are well, too.
