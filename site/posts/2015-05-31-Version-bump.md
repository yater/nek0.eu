description: Transition to new version of Hakyll and a resulting new feature.
---

After roaming around on the internet checking out some of my favourite software projects I realised, that my blog is running on an outdated version of Hakyll, so I bumped it to the newest available version.

This upgrade made it possible to implement Hakyll's relatively new pagination feature into my blog. After tinkering around on it for about a day I finally succeeded.

This means in conclusion, that you can skip from one blogpost to its two chronological neighbours with just one click. Pretty neat.

The next thing I would like to do ist transitioning my markup language for authoring my posts from Markdown to [AsciiDoc][wiki1]. It has some interesting features, which I would like to use. Unfortunately the [Pandoc][wiki2] project does not support reading Asciidoc yet, so I will have to wait.
