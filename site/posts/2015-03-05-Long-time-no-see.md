Hi folks, it has been a while since my last entry here. For that I want to apologize.

The last two months have been tough, but I was able to manage it. First of all I moved to a new flat and my job as student assistant demands more performance from me. I don't see that negatively since I have the feeling of being trusted by my boss and colleagues.

Because of all the other action, my leisure time coding went down, but I still make progress. I have added the feature of pagination on the front page to my gallery system [Eidolon][Eidolon] and worked with the medium site so now all mozilla-based browsers now correctly switch the background image. This was up until now only possible with webkit browsers.

Just recently while browsing through my older posts I realized that this blog exists now for far more than a year. I recall myself wondering at the beginning, whether I would be able to update this blog regularly and I'm glad I could. So thanks to you all out there bearing with me.

(Well I at least hope, that there are some people out there reading this. I have no clue because I don't have any form of user tracking.)
