description: Eventless november has passed
---

I just realised, that it's has been a month, that I have posted my last post
here. Another month has passed I am not really further in my goals. I'm still
in therapy, which takes up most of my time and energy now. This is very
frustrating for me, as I don't have neither time nor energy for my projects,
like my book or writing in general. And to top it all off, when I somehow have a
little time and energy, my mind is blank. I can't come up with ideas. So I'm
either frustrated or frustrated. Great.

Paired with my frustration is fatigue. I'm constantly tired. I can sleep almost
anywhere. I will be having a polysomnography next month because of that. I
dread this appointment. I don't like being all wired up.
