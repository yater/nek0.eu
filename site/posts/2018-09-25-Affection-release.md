description: A new release of my game engine
---

Today I finished up something I had in mind for quite some time: A new relaese
of my game engine affection. It is now officially downloadable from hackage in
its most recent version 0.0.0.9. PLease Don't ask, where version 0.0.0.8 has
gone. I must have lost it somewhere.

With this change you can now build my latest game attempt "tracer" without
having to handle a sandbox or similar.
