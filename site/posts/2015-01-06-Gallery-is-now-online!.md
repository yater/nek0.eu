As I promised by the end of last year, I am happy tp announce, that the gallery system "Eidolon" is now up for testing.

You can reach it over [eidolon.nek0.eu](http://eidolon.nek0.eu) or [nek0.zeigt.photos](http://nek0.zeigt.photos). Feel free to sign up and test it out. It may look a bit barren at first, but I haven't worked much on the appearance yet.

Should you encounter any errors or miss some features, I would be glad receiving an issue at the [github project page](https://github.com/nek0/eidolon)
