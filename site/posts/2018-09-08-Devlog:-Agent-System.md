description: latest breakthrough in my game

Hello again in this little corner of the internet.

As I am busy with my apprenticeship, which started four weeks ago, I don't get
to code so much lately. I am all the more pleased about the outcome of my latest
coding sprint: An Agent System.

In detail this means, that all the NPCs in my game have stats like hunger,
thirst or attention and thus have needs, which have to be fulfilled. And this
they do themselves, given there is a possibility to do so in the current map.
There are toilets, watercoolers and other things present in the game assets, but
the maps are generated randomly, so if they can't find a way to fulfill their
need, they go to the elevator.

This also means, that the NPCs don't walk around randomly, or at least by
default, but walk to targets according to the needs they have.

I also am starting to prepare my talk I'm giving at
[Datenspuren](https://datenspuren.de/2018/). I'm always thankful for input about
what you would like to know. You can leave it here in the comments or use other
means of communication.

See you soon!
